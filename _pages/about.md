## About Me 

I‚Äôm a **tenure-track lecturer** (equivalent to an Assistant Professor in the U.S.) at the [Univerisity of Western Australia (UWA)](https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/persons/tingting-bi). Before joining UWA, I was a research scientist and research fellow at Data61, CSIRO; I obtained my PhD from Monash University, where I was fortunate to be supervised by Australian Laureate Professor [John Grundy](https://sites.google.com/site/johncgrundy/). My research interests are centered around **software architecture of AI-based systems**, **knowledge engineering**, and **responsible AI**. I‚Äôm particularly fascinated by the field of knowledge-based engineering and how human expertise contributes to the process of eliciting requirements, designing, and implementing systems. In addition to my academic pursuits, I actively engage as a Program Committee member and reviewer for prestigious software engineering journals and conferences, including TSE, TOSEM, ICSE, and more.
