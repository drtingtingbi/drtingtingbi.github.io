About me
======
I’m a **tenure-track lecturer** (a.k.a. Assistant Professor) at the Univerisity of Western Australia (UWA). Before I joined UWA, I was a research scientist at Data61, CSIRO; I obtained my PhD degree from Monash University, where I was fortunate to be mentored by Professor John Grundy. My research interests are centered around software architecture, knowledge engineering, and responsible AI. I’m particularly fascinated by the field of knowledge-based engineering and how human expertise contributes to the process of eliciting requirements, designing, and implementing systems. In addition to my academic pursuits, I actively engage as a Program Committee member and reviewer for prestigious software engineering journals and conferences, including TSE, TOSEM, ICSE, and more.

### News!
