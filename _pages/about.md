## About Me 👩🏻‍💻

I’m a lecturer (equivalent to an Assistant Professor in the U.S.) in the [the School of Computing and Information Systems](https://cis.unimelb.edu.au/research/computer-science/research/software-engineering) at [The University of Melbourne](https://cis.unimelb.edu.au/) and an adjunct lecturer in the department of Computer Science and Software Engineering at [The Univerisity of Western Australia (UWA)](https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/persons/tingting-bi). Before joining UniMelb and UWA, I was a research scientist and research fellow at [Data61, CSIRO](https://research.csiro.au/ss/people/alumni/); I got my PhD from Monash University in 2023, where I was fortunate to be supervised by Australian Laureate Professor [John Grundy](https://sites.google.com/site/johncgrundy/). My research interests are centered around **Software architecture of AI-based systems**, **LLMs for knowledge engineering**, and **Responsible AI**. I’m particularly fascinated by the field of knowledge-based engineering and how human expertise contributes to the process of eliciting requirements, designing, and implementing systems. In addition to my academic pursuits, I actively engage as a Program Committee member and reviewer for prestigious software engineering journals and conferences, including TSE, TOSEM, ICSE, and more.
