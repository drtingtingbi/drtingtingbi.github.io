Apart from my work as a researcher, I deeply value my family and the time we spend together. In my leisure time, I am passionate about rock climbing 🧗‍♀️ and kitesurfing 🪁 activities that allow me to stay active and connected with nature. These pursuits not only provide a thrilling physical challenge but also offer a perfect balance to my professional life, enabling me to rejuvenate and maintain a well-rounded lifestyle.
